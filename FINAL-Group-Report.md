## 4) Department of Transportation
### Chosen SDLC model: Waterfall
<!-- Add justification, which includes key aspects below-->
For the dept of transportation project we chose to go with waterfall. This is because of the extensive documentation they require, as well as the strict specifications. Additionally our team has already worked on similar projects so we already have workflows and lines of communication set up so we would not need something like agile in order to orginize our team.

The deciding aspects of our choice were the extensive documentation and the very specific expectations. These 2 requirements are most suited for waterfall due to its linear design which would force us to have extensive documentation at each step while also following the specifications very closely. 

### Other Considerations 
<!-- Add other considered options below-->

We considered using spiral, however the specifications were not subject to change and there were not really any high levels of risk or uncertainty involved, so we chose waterfall.
