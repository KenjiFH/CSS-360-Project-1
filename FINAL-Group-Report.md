## 4) Department of Transportation
### Chosen SDLC model: Waterfall
<!-- Add justification, which includes key aspects below-->
For the dept of transportation project we chose to go with waterfall. This is because of the extensive documentation they require, as well as the strict specifications. Additionally our team has already worked on similar projects so we already have workflows and lines of communication set up so we would not need something like agile in order to orginize our team.

The deciding aspects of our choice were the extensive documentation and the very specific expectations. These 2 requirements are most suited for waterfall due to its linear design which would force us to have extensive documentation at each step while also following the specifications very closely. 

### Other Considerations 
<!-- Add other considered options below-->

We considered using spiral, however the specifications were not subject to change and there were not really any high levels of risk or uncertainty involved, so we chose waterfall.


## 5) Reducing Traffic
### Chosen SDLC model: Spiral
> This project combines complex hardware (GPS trackers, cameras, sensors) with software systems. The Spiral model is ideal because it supports early risk assessment, continuous prototyping, and can handle uncertainties, which are crucial for integrating embedded systems with real-time infrastructure.

### Other Considerations 
- **Incremental** –  Good for delivering parts of the project in stages, but lacks the risk management that Spiral provides.


## 6) Educational game
### Chosen SDLC model: Agile
< This project needs to be built quickly and improved based on feedback from teachers and administrators. Agile works well because it supports *fast updates*, changing requirements, and close teamwork  which is perfect for a small, active team building an educational game.

### Other Considerations 
- **Incremental** – Could work, but Agile offers *faster* response to feedback and better stakeholder engagement.

### Other Considerations

## 7) Global Health
