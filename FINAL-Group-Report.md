# MARS Project Life-Cycles Group Report


## 1) New e-Commerce Site
### Chosen SDLC model: Incremental
<!-- Add justification, which includes key aspects below-->
Since we are working on a website, an incremental development approach is the best option, beating the linear waterfall model in terms of speed and adaptability, two key aspects that are necessary in the
rapidly changing business landscape. Businesses won't have a full vision of their desired site at the start, so they will want to continously add and remove features over time. With the incremental model,
we will be able to meet those demands in a quick and timely manner

### Other Considerations 
<!-- Add other considered options below-->
- **Agile**

  Agile was another consideration, since it is based off of the incremental model, however, due to the varied skill levels within the team and the management expectation that the team will use their
  provided in-house templates with custom scripting and extentions with minor modifications, it may be difficult to achieve smooth workflow between the team members and the separate group.

## 4) Department of Transportation
### Chosen SDLC model: Waterfall
<!-- Add justification, which includes key aspects below-->
For the dept of transportation project we chose to go with waterfall. This is because of the extensive documentation they require, as well as the strict specifications. Additionally our team has already worked on similar projects so we already have workflows and lines of communication set up so we would not need something like agile in order to orginize our team.

The deciding aspects of our choice were the extensive documentation and the very specific expectations. These 2 requirements are most suited for waterfall due to its linear design which would force us to have extensive documentation at each step while also following the specifications very closely. 

### Other Considerations 
<!-- Add other considered options below-->

We considered using spiral, however the specifications were not subject to change and there were not really any high levels of risk or uncertainty involved, so we chose waterfall.
