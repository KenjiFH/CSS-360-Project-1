## 1) New e-Commerce Site
### Chosen SDLC model: Incremental
<!-- Add justification, which includes key aspects below-->
Since we are working on a website, an incremental development approach is the best option, beating the linear waterfall model in terms of speed and adaptability, two key aspects that are necessary in the
rapidly changing business landscape. Businesses won't have a full vision of their desired site at the start, so they will want to continously add and remove features over time. With the incremental model,
we will be able to meet those demands in a quick and timely manner

### Other Considerations 
<!-- Add other considered options below-->
- **Agile**

  Agile was another consideration, since it is based off of the incremental model, however, due to the varied skill levels within the team and the management expectation that the team will use their
  provided in-house templates with custom scripting and extentions with minor modifications, it may be difficult to achieve smooth workflow between the team members and the separate group.

## 2) Dental office site
### Chosen SDLC model: Agile
<!-- Add justification, which includes key aspects below-->
Again, we are working on a website, so adaptability to new client requests and fast delivery are the key aspects to focus on. In this case, we have a bit more freedom in what tools we can use, and we have a closer line of communication to our client, which is our dentist friend. That makes agile the best SDLC, as we can gather "user stories" from our client, and quickly deliver features to their website in order to draw in more patients.

### Other Considerations 
<!-- Add other considered options below-->
- **Incremental**

  Because we have a client that is not strict on deadlines, and wishes to continually add features future according to scenarios described by them, Agile will be the optimal model, as it is faster than incremental developement. We     can take their "user stories" and implement features to satisfy what they want to be able to do with the site.

## 3) Nuclear Power Plant
### Chosen SDLC model: Spiral
<!-- Add justification, which includes key aspects below-->

We chose to go with a spiral model for the nuclear power plant. This is because when working with something as dangerous as a nuclear power plant, risk mitigation is key and spiral is best at risk analysis and prevention. The multiple iterations of a spiral model would also help us to catch any bugs or errors early on, which would be disastrous if not found. Spirals risk mitigation, as well as prototyping gives it the best case out of all the SDLC for this project.



### Other Considerations 
<!-- Add other considered options below-->
Waterfall was another possibility, however the regulations of nuclear powerplants are subject to change, and waterfall is pretty linear in that regard, which would also be worse for finding potential errors or risks, due to lack of prototyping and risk assessment. 


## 4) Department of Transportation
### Chosen SDLC model: Waterfall
<!-- Add justification, which includes key aspects below-->
For the dept of transportation project we chose to go with waterfall. This is because of the extensive documentation they require, as well as the strict specifications. Additionally our team has already worked on similar projects so we already have workflows and lines of communication set up so we would not need something like agile in order to orginize our team.

The deciding aspects of our choice were the extensive documentation and the very specific expectations. These 2 requirements are most suited for waterfall due to its linear design which would force us to have extensive documentation at each step while also following the specifications very closely. 

### Other Considerations 
<!-- Add other considered options below-->

We considered using spiral, however the specifications were not subject to change and there were not really any high levels of risk or uncertainty involved, so we chose waterfall.


## 5) Reducing Traffic
### Chosen SDLC model: Spiral
We decided to go with the spiral model for this project because it involves complex hardware like GPS trackers, cameras, sensors,  and software systems. Spiral works well here since it helps us identify and manage risks early, build prototypes throughout, and handle the kind of uncertainty that comes with real-time, *embedded systems*.

### Other Considerations 
We thought about using Incremental since it’s good for breaking the project into smaller pieces, but it doesn’t offer the same level of *risk management* that Spiral does, which we felt was important for this kind of system.

## 6) Educational game
### Chosen SDLC model: Agile
We went with Agile for the educational game since it needs to be built quickly and updated based on feedback from teachers and admins. Agile’s a good fit because it lets us make changes quickly, push out updates fast, and stay in close communication, which works well for a small, hands-on team like ours.

### Other Considerations 
We thought about using Incremental, but Agile seemed better since it gives us more flexibility to respond to feedback quickly and stay connected with stakeholders throughout the project.

## 7) Global Health
### Chosen SDLC model: Incremental
Ultimately we decided on the incremental development approach because the possibility for further grants if impact is shown. As we need to show impact, we need to use an approach that deploys early, and has room to accomodate change. The incremental approach works perfectly here, as it allows each deliverable to be usable by customers to some degree, which allows us to show our impact, and receive further grants.

### Other Considerations 
We considered agile and spiral for this as well, but spiral ultimately has one deliverable, which would not work well here. Agile would generally work well in a situation like this, but we are not relying on customer feedback for development. We are also working with a health system, which generally requires more careful planning.
