# MARS Project 1 Individual: Gabe Griego
1. ### New e-Commerce site
Since the employer wants lots of features that work based off of customer interaction, we should use **agile** development. We also have to work with another team, as well as our own team coming from very mixed backgrounds and skill levels. Agiles focus on customer feedback and communication would work perfectly for this.

2. ### Dental office site
Our friend wants to periodically add things, so we should use an **incremental** approach. Continuously adding functionality is exactly what the incremental approach does. With incremental development, the site is usable after each increment, and new features are added on through continued development, perfect for this request.

3. ### Nuclear Power Plant
We are creating something that is safety-critical, and we do not have explicit instructions, we should use the **spiral** model. The spiral model allows for extensive testing and prototyping, but is not as rigid as the waterfall model, which is great in this scenario as we are outsourcing some of the work, and only producing one end product that should be fully functional.

4. ### Department of Transportation
The DoT has a 100 page document detailing every requirement, very explicitly, so we should use the **waterfall** model. We should use waterfall as we have very detailed requirements, and can afford the rigidity and extensive planning phase of the waterfall model. 

5. ### Reducing Traffic
This is a complicated system, and we do not have a very large amount of explicit instructions, so we should use the **spiral** model. These are imbedded systems which are very important, but we also are working with incredibly complicated hardware, one that would benefit from prototyping and flexible development.

6. ### Educational game
Since we are developing a game, and our feedback relies heavily on customer interaction, we should use **agile** development. With evolving requirements, and constant need for change and interaction with customers, agile works best as it is very flexible, with constantly evolving and releasing deliverables.

7. ### Global Health
This software does not involve constant customer feedback, and would work better with semi-rigid requirements with the ability to develop further as we get more grants, this aligns well with **incremental** development. Our team is not going to be ginormous, and since we are a small team, we could benefit from detailed requirements to send to our team-members. While this software is not very safety-dependent, it is still dealing with human health, and should have dedicated planning phases with careful consideration.
