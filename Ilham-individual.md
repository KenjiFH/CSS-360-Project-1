#1:
Agile is the best model for this project because it supports frequent updates and ongoing improvements. Since the site needs to bring customers back and adjust to changing needs, Agile helps us 
quickly apply feedback and make changes.

#2: 
I think the best model would be Agile. Since there’s no hard deadline, we don’t have to rush to finish everything at once. The customer plans to add complex features later on, 
and Agile works well for that because most of the requirements aren’t defined at the beginning and tend to change over time. They’ll also be involved throughout the process, providing feedback as
new features are added.

#3: 
The Spiral model is best for this project because it focuses on risk management through a step-by-step process that allows us to address the most critical risks early on. Nuclear power is a high risk, and we 
can't afford any failures because it can have serious consequences for people and the environment. This model will help us address the riskiest components first and refine them over time.

#4: 
The Waterfall model is the best for this project because the requirements are clear from the detailed 100-page specification. Since there is a fixed 18-month deadline and we have an experienced team, 
a linear approach makes the most sense here. 

#5: 
The Incremental model is best for this project because we can build and deliver it in smaller parts. Since it involves GPS tracking, traffic sensors, and digital signs, this approach lets us test 
each piece before putting everything together.

#6: 
The Agile model is best for this project because we can have continuous development and regular feedback. Since educators and stakeholders will be testing the product frequently, Agile 
will support ongoing improvements based on their input.

#7: 
The Incremental model works well for this project because the team will start small and grow over time. With 3 experienced developers, an initial version can be built and tested, adding new 
features as more resources become available.
