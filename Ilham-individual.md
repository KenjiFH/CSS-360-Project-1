## 1: New e-Commerce site 2
> <strong>Agile</strong> is the best model for this project because it supports frequent updates and ongoing improvements.
>
> Since the site needs to bring customers back and adjust to changing needs, Agile helps us quickly apply feedback and make changes.

## 2: Dental office site 2
> I think the best model would be <strong>Agile</strong>. Since there’s no hard deadline, we don’t have to rush to finish everything at once. 
>
> The customer plans to add complex features later on, and Agile works well for that because most of the requirements aren’t defined at the beginning 
and tend to change over time. They’ll also be involved throughout the process, providing feedback as new features are added.

## 3: Nuclear Power Plant 2
> The **Spiral model** is best for this project because it focuses on risk management through a step-by-step process that allows us to address the most critical risks early on.
>
> Nuclear power is a **high risk**, and we can't afford any failures because it can have serious consequences for people and the environment. This model will help us address the riskiest components first and refine them over time.

### *Why the Spiral Model Works:*
1. **Step-by-step approach**: Breaks the project into smaller, manageable parts.
2. **Risk management**: Focuses on identifying and addressing risks early.
3. **Continuous improvement**: Refines components over time, minimizing the chance of failure.

## 4: Department of Transportation 
> The <strong>Waterfall</strong> model is the best for this project because the requirements are clear from the detailed 100-page specification. 
>
> Since there is a fixed 18-month deadline and we have an experienced team, a linear approach makes the most sense here. 

## 5: Reducing Traffic
> The <strong>Incremental</strong> model is best for this project because we can build and deliver it in smaller parts. Since it involves GPS tracking, traffic sensors, and
>
> digital signs, this approach lets us test each piece before putting everything together.

## 6: Educational game 
> The <strong>Agile</strong> model is best for this project because we can have continuous development and regular feedback.
>
>  Since educators and stakeholders will be testing the product frequently, Agile will support ongoing improvements based on their input.

## 7: Global Health 
> The <strong>Incremental</strong> model works well for this project because the team will start small and grow over time. With 3 experienced developers, an initial version can
>
>  be built and tested, adding new features as more resources become available.
