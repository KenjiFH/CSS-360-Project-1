# Project life-cycles, individual portion

## 1) New e-Commerce Site
**Selected SDLC model: Incremental**

We are already provided in-house templates with custom scripting, extentions, and a Java interpreter. Because management expects us to use these tools with minor modifications, 
definte requirements before adding any extentions to the templates or scripts, and schedule their development with separate groups, we will need a little more time compared to agile methods. <br>
New hires and interns will impact the team velocity if an agile SDLC were used.

## 2) Dental office site
**Selected SDLC model: Agile**

Because of the client's flexible deadlines and desire to continuously add features to the website, we will want to continuously work alongside them to deliver current and future updates. <br>
Since the website capabilities will not be defined all at once, but rather incrementally other time, constant communication with the client will be necessary, gathering the desired features through "user stories".
