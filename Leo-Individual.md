# Project life-cycles, individual portion

## 1) New e-Commerce Site
**Selected SDLC model: Incremental**

We are already provided in-house templates with custom scripting, extentions, and a Java interpreter. Because management expects us to use these tools with minor modifications, 
definte requirements before adding any extentions to the templates or scripts, and schedule their development with separate groups, we will need a little more time compared to agile methods. <br>
New hires and interns will impact the team velocity if an agile SDLC were used.

## 2) Dental office site
**Selected SDLC model: Agile**

Because of the client's flexible deadlines and desire to continuously add features to the website, we will want to continuously work alongside them to deliver current and future updates. <br>
Since the website capabilities will not be defined all at once, but rather incrementally other time, constant communication with the client will be necessary, gathering the desired features through "user stories".

## 3) Nuclear Power Plant
**Selected SDLC model: Spiral**

Software development for a nuclear power plant will be a large-scale project, and thus, steps must be taken to minimize risks throughout the project, with constant validation throughout the process. <br>
Because the software must be robust, able to deal with hardware failure, and able to fail safely, we need to make sure this is possible through constant requirements specification and validation. <br>
Should any issues or changes arise, it will be easy to deal with.

## 4) Department of Transportation
**Selected SDLC model: Waterfall**

We have detailed specifications on what the expected software should be, and are given a deadline to complete it by. Because the team is comprised of experienced staff, there should be no issues sequentially working <br>
through the steps of the software development life cycle.
