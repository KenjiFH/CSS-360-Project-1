## Case Justification

### 1. New e-Commerce Site

**Lifecycle Model:** Incremental Development Model

**Justification:**
The incremental model fits this project because it allow PerfectApparel to build on their existing Java interpreter with minimal modifications while progressively adding HTML5 capabilities and new features. This approach accommodates the mixed-experience team, reduces technical risk, and enables early delivery of core functionality and validate customer experience before full implementation of customization features.

### 2. Dental Office Site

**Lifecycle Model:** Incremental Development Model

**Justification:**
The incremental mode fits this web-site because the initial requirements are simple, while future features (online appointment, text reminders) remain conceptual. The flexible timeline and single developer team could be able to adjust development paces relatively freely.

### 3. Nuclear Power Plant

**Lifecycle Model:** Waterfall Model

**Justification:**
The is a safety critical project. The restrict nuclear regulatory require rigorous documentation and formal verification at each development phase. The long term development period allows analyzing specification and failure cases thoroughly with experts, as well as hardware and fail safety measures. 

### 4. Department of Transportation

**Lifecycle Model:** Waterfall Model

**Justification:**
This project has comprehensive requirements (100 pages specification), fixed delivery date (18 months), and the development team is familiar with transportation systems, which reduces requirement analysis risk. The government contracts typically require formal documentation and deliverables, which aligning with waterfall's sequential processes.

### 5. Reducing Traffic

**Lifecycle Model:** Spiral Model

**Justification:**
Though the team has rich experiences on hardware/software, but this project require integrating distributed computing, networking, car tracking hardware, and real-time traffic updates. The most significant risk would be prototype iterations before full-scale implementation. Spiral model could help eliminating the riskiest factors during the processes.


### 6. Educational Game

**Lifecycle Model:** Agile Model

**Justification:**
The project is fast paces with a small-scale team members. The team has tight relationship to the industry, and customers would like to provide testing efforts during the development process. Agile model fits this project well.


### 7. Global Health

**Lifecycle Model:** Spiral Model

**Justification:**
The risk analysis through prototyping is critical to secure the further grants. With a small initial team which planning expansion, spiral model allows risk-control, and further addressing the complex, potentially undefined requirements.
