## #1: New e-Commerce site — *Incremental*

Due to the clear requirements and already in-place tech stack, the best option would be incremental development. Also, because of the expectations that we are to add minor improvements using their already defined tools on a regular basis, incremental would be better than agile due to the complex and interwoven base.

## #2: Dental office site — *Agile*

Because of the flexibility of this project and lack of clear specifications, agile would be the best bet. Agile would also shine due to the desire for continuous improvements and new features.

---

## #3: Nuclear Power Plant — *Waterfall*

Due to the critical nature of this project and the need for every safety precaution to be followed, the only option would be a waterfall model. Rigorous testing is needed at every step, and a complete product is required. Also, because the timeframe is 10 years, there is no need to rush the testing or skip anything.

## #4: Department of Transportation — *Waterfall*

Because of the longer timeframe, very detailed specifications, linear nature of the project, and extensive documentation, waterfall would be best suited for the task. Also, due to the team’s prior experience, communication and task management should already be efficient, making upfront planning effective.

## #5: Reducing Traffic — *Spiral*

Because of the critical nature, potential risks, and need for a robust end product, the Spiral model would be the best choice. It allows for prototyping, risk assessment, and iterative refinement throughout the process.

---

## #6: Educational game — *Agile*

Due to the small team size, rapid development requirements, and evolving set of requirements, agile is the best fit. Agile also allows flexibility in team roles, so members can adapt and support each other. The need for early prototypes and customer feedback makes agile especially beneficial.

---

## #7: Global Health — *Agile*

Given the small starting team and the need to release a minimum viable product (MVP) quickly to demonstrate impact and secure further funding, agile is the most appropriate. It also supports integrating new team members smoothly as the company grows.
